= System setup

You will interact with a total of 3 systems: the primary lab hypervisor, a container registry, and an image mode VM.  Most of your work will be done on the lab hypervisor, and you will create the target image mode VM as part of the exercises. Caution should be taken when instructed to reboot a system that you are on the correct host.

== System purpose

*Container build host*: One of the main parts of this lab is the build environment. The primary lab machine serves as a basic container build environment. The RHEL container tools (podman, buildah, skopeo) will be used throughout this lab to do simple container creation. This is all that is needed for a basic build host. You will also create the Containerfiles and any other needed configuration files on this host.

*Container registry*: The registry in this lab environment is a basic registry with no authentication or management tooling. More tools, workflows, and insights are available from more modern registry solutions like quay.io. For the purposes of the exercises, a simple registry to host images is all that's needed.

*Target host*: A KVM based virtual machine will be created during an exercise to serve as an install location for the image mode system. Any cloud, virtual, or bare metal machine can be used in practice. This lab won't go into detail on local management of KVM, but will use virt-install and virsh to manage the local VM.
