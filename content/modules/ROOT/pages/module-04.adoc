= Updating bootc systems

In this lab, you will learn how to create updated images and apply them to bootc hosts. 

[#update-container]
== Updating the bootc image

We've created our first system but there are a few things that might be missing we typically 
do to our systems. Not requiring a password every time we use sudo might be something we allow 
admins to do. We may also need to put notices on logins or present info in the MOTD. Let's make 
some changes to how the system behaves. While we're at it, lets update the index page too.

First, let's set up a directory structure that mimics `/etc` on our lab host and create the 
files we need inside it. This allows us to add all the configs at once with a single command and in 
a single layer of the image.

NOTE: This is a local directory, relative to the location of the Containerfile, not the system `/etc/`.
These files are also provided in the `examples/update` directory. 

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p etc/sudoers.d
----

Since the motd file lives in the top level of `/etc`, that one command creates all the paths 
we need for this exercise. RHEL supports drop-in directories for several services and applications, including 
`sudo` privileges. Drop-in support lets us add a file to a `<servicename>.d` directory rather than editing 
the main configuration file. You might already be familiar with drop-in config files from working with Apache and 
it's `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory.


Let's address the sudoers password first, by allowing users in the wheel group to not need to enter their password.

[source,bash]
----
nano etc/sudoers.d/wheel
----

Add the following and save the file

----
# Enable passwordless sudo for the wheel group
%wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
----

And let's provide a message of the day!

[source,bash]
----
nano etc/motd
----

Add the following and save the file

----
Welcome to the image mode lifestyle!
----

Now that we have our new configs, we can add them to the Containerfile and rebuild the image.

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4

COPY certs/004-summit.conf /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/004-summit.conf

ADD etc/ /etc # <1>

RUN dnf install -y httpd
RUN echo "Hello Red Hat Summit Connect 2024!!" > /var/www/html/index.html

RUN systemctl enable httpd.service
----
<1> Adding the files we just created

If you aren't familiar, the `ADD` directive has some extra capabilities over the `COPY` command we used for the SSL certs. Where 
`COPY` only works on a single file, `ADD` can work on complete directories or even unpack tar files. This can 
be very useful when dealing with standard configs, but could make the Containerfile a little opaque if 
folks are unfamilar with the syntax.

We rebuild the image with our updates the same way we originally built it. 

[source,bash]
----
podman build --file Containerfile --tag summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
----

And make sure to push it to the registry:

[source,bash]
----
podman push summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
----

[#update-vm]
== Updating the virtual machine

The last virtual machine you have created during this workshop should still be running. You can check this with

[source,bash]
----
virsh --connect qemu:///system list
----

And the output should the virtual machine called `qcow` as `running`.

Now you can ssh into the virtual machine:

[source,bash]
----
ssh lab-user@qcow-vm
----

The `bootc update` command will download and prepare a detected update for use at the next boot. This means updates are offline, and 
can be applied at any time. Changes will only take effect when the system reboots. (Reminder, the password for `sudo` is `lb1506`):

[source,bash]
----
sudo bootc update
----

The output should look something like this:

....
Loading usr/lib/ostree/prepare-root.conf
Queued for next boot: summit.registry/lb1506:bootc-auth
  Version: 9.20240501.0
  Digest: sha256:c5a5bc63cc5d081c528c82a177d0c5eac996a16fa3a651f93d07825302ff5336

Removed layers:   6     Size: 2.3 kB
Added layers:     6     Size: 2.2 kB
....

Notice that `bootc update` provides information about the layers that have been modified. 

[source,bash]
----
sudo bootc status
----

The output should look like:

<1> You can see the staged changes in addition to current running state of the host in `bootc status`. The SHA in the `staged` block 
should match the Digest from the output of `bootc update`. 

The last step for the change to take is to reboot the virtual machine. Before doing so, please make sure you are logged in to the
virtual machine and not the hypervisor (the prompt should look like `[lab-user@qcow-vm ~]$`):

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl reboot
----

[#testing]
== Testing the changes

After a short wait, log back into the system and and you should see the message of the day after logging in successfully.

[source,bash]
----
ssh lab-user@qcow-vm
----

We can check on our sudoers policy change as well. You shouldn't be prompted for you password:
[source,bash]
----
sudo cat /etc/motd
----

What about the change to the index page?
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost
sudo cat /var/www/html/index.html
----

....
Hello Red Hat
....

The new text doesn't appear, and it's also not in the file on disk. This is *expected* based on 
how `bootc` handles directories and image contents during changes.

Stay logged into the VM to explore this in the next module.
