= Build a bootc container image
In this step you will transform an application container to a bootc image.

[#write]
== Modify the Containerfile

NOTE: The `vim` editor is also available. Users of `vim` should already know the basics
of opening, saving and exiting the editor. The instructions will reflect `nano` commands.
All of the files used can be found in the `examples` directory.

Let's start with a typical application container and convert it to an image mode host. We'll start
with something simple, a basic webserver running on the Red Hat Universal Base Image. To start the editor:

[source,bash]
----
nano Containerfile
----

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi

RUN dnf install -y httpd
RUN echo "Hello Red Hat" > /var/www/html/index.html

ENTRYPOINT /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
----

A brief explanation of the key directives in the Containerfile above:

  * `FROM` -> the base container image
  * `ENTRYPOINT` -> the command that will be executed by default at run time

You can now replace the contents as follows:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4

COPY certs/004-summit.conf /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/004-summit.conf

RUN dnf install -y httpd
RUN echo "Hello Red Hat" > /var/www/html/index.html

RUN systemctl enable httpd.service
----

TIP: In `nano`, you can save and exit with `Ctrl+x`, followed by the key `y` at the "Save modified buffer?" prompt 
and the `Enter` key at the prompt to keep the filename.

Let's talk about the effects of these changes:

  * The `FROM` field is now pointing to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 bootc imageÂ instead of the UBI base image.
  This new bootc image is a complete version of RHEL 9.4, much like the KVM image available on the Customer Portal. This 
  image includes all of the OS components to run as a host as well as the new `bootc` commands. It is built using `ostree`
  to facilitate the transactional updates that marks an image mode deployment from a package mode host.
  
  * `RUN systemctl enable httpd.service` replaces the `ENTRYPOINT`.  
  To start the `httpd` service at host startup as you use `systemctl` would with any other host. There's no 
  need to specify an executable that should be run when the container is started by a container engine like 
  podman. 

  * `COPY certs/004-summit.conf...` copies a single file from our helper directory into the container. This config snippet
  will allow us to pull container images without TLS verification in the lab environment. This is only necessary based on 
  the use of self-signed certificates with the lack of an internal CA available.

[#build]
== Build the first bootc image

As with application containers, you can build this container with standard tools:

  * `--file Containerfile` -> what Containerfile to use for the build
  * `--tag summit.registry/lb1506:bootc` -> the "tag" or name of the resulting container in the format
     <registry>/<repository>:<tag>

[source,bash]
----
podman build --file Containerfile --tag summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
----

If the above command is succesful, the last two lines of the output should read like this:

....
Successfully tagged summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
f1bea10eb37acf2e78a9b01c6242110c1901adbaf40dbce479241c6c735c58da
....

[#distribute]
== Distributing the bootc image

Now that we have a full operating system in a standard OCI container image, we can use
standard container registries to host and distribute our OS images. The only atypical thing so far 
is what's in the base image. How we added software or files to the image is the same as any other 
application container. The special sauce of `bootc` comes when a host is running.

We have a registry available within the lab environment we can push our image to:

[source,bash]
----
podman push summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
----

That's all there is to designing and building a complete operating system. Start with a base, then add software and 
related configurations. You not only have the record of that work you can put under source control in the form of the 
Containerfile, you also have the binary image stored and versioned in the registry.

You've built your first bootc image, and it's now published for use. How do we get from here to a running system?
